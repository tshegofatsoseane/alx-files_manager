# Building a File Management Platform

## Introduction
In this project, I will be building a simple platform to upload and view files. The project will cover various aspects of backend development, including user authentication, using NodeJS for the server, MongoDB for data storage, Redis for temporary data storage, pagination for handling large datasets, and background processing for generating thumbnails for images.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, I will gain a deeper understanding of the following concepts:
- Creating an API with Express
- User authentication using tokens
- Storing data in MongoDB
- Utilizing Redis for temporary data storage
- Setting up and using a background worker
- Implementing pagination to handle large datasets

## Project Structure
The project will be structured as follows:
- **utils folder**: This folder will contain utility functions that can be reused throughout the project.
- **API with Express**: I will create an API using the Express framework to handle user requests.
- **User Authentication**: Implement token-based authentication to secure the API endpoints.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Store file metadata and permissions in MongoDB.
- **Redis Integration**: Utilize Redis for temporary data storage, such as caching file data.
- **File Upload and Viewing**: Implement endpoints to upload new files and view existing files.
- **Changing File Permissions**: Allow users to change permissions (e.g., read/write) of their files.
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Implement background processing to generate thumbnails for image files.

## Project Implementation
Throughout the project, I will adhere to best practices in coding, including proper code organization, documentation, and linting using ESLint.

## Conclusion
By the end of this project, I will have built a fully functional file management platform that covers various backend concepts. This project will serve as a comprehensive learning experience, helping me solidify my understanding of backend development with NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, and more.

## Setup
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the server using `npm start`.
4. Access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.
